The repository is used for the workshop Builing a GraphQL Server in .NET 8.

The workshop documents for Rider and Visual Studio are included as PDF files in the root of this repo.

The queries used to interact with the server are included in the queries.txt file.

Have fun creating your own GraphQL Service.
